# Find CSV Duplicates

### Description:
This repository code for getting the duplicate records from the provided csv file.
- You can just clone this repo and get the code up with the Intellij or any other development environment.
- It will have a UI to display the option to upload the source csv file and then download the duplicate file.

### Dependencies:
  - Java Spring Boot - Java 1.8

- I has a basic UI for you to find duplicates based on any of the column number of you csv file, and if you leave it blank it will run for finding the whole record duplication.
- I would love to share it with you guys too. It needs a lot of improvement so I would appreciate any bugs discovery along with resolution and enhancements. ;)
